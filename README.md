The source of this project is https://www.bigmessowires.com/nibbler/ and where the schematic and the data files can be found:
"Download the Nibbler file archive containing all the design files and tools".

I use the schematic from pong74ls so the names of tunnel/labels etc. can be a little bit different, see 

https://github.com/pong74ls/Nibbler/blob/master/Documentation/Nibbler%20-%20Schematic.pdf

The simulation is made with

24 march - Cpu4-Part5 is my first attempt with the Roms uploaded with bin-files taken from the Nibbler File Archive here:

The display shows no sign of life.
The bin files get the extension .data when saved in Simulide.
